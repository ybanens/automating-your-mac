# lesson-template

Learn-Static Lesson Template is a minimal Jekyll theme with sidebar content nav for creating lesson and workshop websites using Markdown.
The sidebar nav supports pages nested into sections to help organize your lesson content. 
The template provides Liquid includes to simplify adding Bootstrap components to your pages.

## Creating Content

Content follows these conventions:

- All documentation files are written in Markdown. For clearer version control, editing, accessibility, and reusability please:
    - write one sentence per line.
    - always provide a blank line between elements (i.e. headers, paragraphs, lists, code blocks are always followed by a blank line).
    - headers should follow logical order on page without skipping levels. The page template includes an "h1" using the `title` set in the front matter--thus additional headers on the page should start at "h2", i.e. `##` in markdown.
    - code and variables should be given `code` class using backticks, filenames should be given in "quotes".
- Markdown files are located in the "content" folder and can be further organized into folders inside if desired.

## Create Navigation 

The sidebar navigation menu is controlled by front matter added to each page. 
There are two ways a page can appear in the nav: individual or in a section drop down.

The nav follows these rules:

- **Individual listing:** To list a page in the nav individually, add `nav_order` to the front matter of a content page. e.g. `nav_order: 1`. Do *not* include `section_id` or `section` in the front matter.
- **Section dropdown:** To create a "section" drop down, on the first content page of the section, add `nav_order` and `section_id` to the front matter. The value of `section_id` will be displayed as the label for the section drop down. e.g. `section_id: Workshop Prep`. The page's title will be listed as the first item in the section dropdown.
- **Section pages:** To add additional pages to the section dropdown, add `section` and `nav_order` to the front matter of a markdown file. The value of `section` must match a `section_id` set up on another markdown file. The page's title will appear under the corresponding section dropdown. The pages in the section will sort according to `nav_order` within the section--however, the page that sets up the section (with `section_id`) will always be listed first. 

Note: 

- The nav listings (individual pages and sections) will be sorted by the value of `nav_order`.
- If a markdown stub does not have `nav_order` *or* `section` in the front matter, the page will **not** appear anywhere in the navigation. Occasionally you might want to create pages that aren't linked in the nav, just be sure to link to them from somewhere else!
- The values of `section_id` / `section` should be unique. If you create multiple sections with the same name, the nav won't work as expected!

### Example Front Matter

Individual listing:

```
---
nav_order: 1
title: Introduction
---
```

Section lead:

```
---
section_id: Getting Started
nav_order: 3
title: Install Git and GitHub Desktop
---
```

Section content:

```
---
section: Getting Started
nav_order: 2
title: Configure Git
---
```
